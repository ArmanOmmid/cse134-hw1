## Question 3
### Mouse Navigation
1. I was unable to navigate to Top Headlines. I found that the extension would only read content when the content was clicked on, but if the content linked to another page, then I would lose the original page that had Top Headlines on it. Every once in a while I had to check to see if I was on a different page entirely and reset the link.
2. I was able to find the Accesibility Training page, but I couldn't find the FAQ section about training being archived.
### Command Navigation
1. It was generally difficult to navigate the ESPN site through the whole experience. Starting from the top, I was quickly navigated to the footer section early one it sounded like and then there was so much content to sift through I wasn't exactly sure where I was at any point. Additionally, the content being read didn't really give any cues about what kind of content I was selecting at, just descriptions of headlines with random information being spouted by the extension. I was generally confused what parts of the site I was ever at except for specific parts fo the footer.
2. It was much easier navigating this page as every content element that would be selected / navigated to by the command was much more descriptive in terms of what was being selected. Although I couldn't really tell where I was spacially on the site, I felt like the things I was navigating through were much easier to understand.
